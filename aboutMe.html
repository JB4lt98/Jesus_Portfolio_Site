        <p class="par">Hey there! My name is Jesus Baltazar. At the time of writing this I go to CUNY Hunter College. As for the reason I am making this site, I want to major in Computer Science (BA), and want something to log my work and work on something for my resume at the same time! Here is what I look like!</p>

        <!-- Why code -->
        <div class="sticky-header">
            <h2 class="header2"><u>Why code?</u></h2>
        </div>
        <p class="par"> My first introduction to the world of coding was in the 6th grade of middle school. I went to JHS 220 (John J Pershing), and my first language that I learned was HTML! Since then, I knew I wanted to do something with programming, I just did not know what.</p>
        <p class="par"> I didn't receive much exposure to coding after the 6th grade, until my second year of High school, (I went to Brooklyn College Academy). I learned Python, and its relation to game development. This pushed me into wanting to get into that realm of programming. I tried to download game engines and learn them, but rather opted in for the more basic approach, learning more languages.</p>
        <p class="par"> When I reached college, I knew I had been exposed to the world of code and was comfortable enough to where I wanted to pursue it on my own time as well as in school. At the time of writing this, I took one class on Python, and one class on C++, and on my own time, started to learn Javascript, and also practicing HTML and CSS. I intend to keep going on this path and introduce new projects and ideas to this site.</p>
        <p class="par"> I initially entered college with the thought that I would be a Game Developer/Game Designer. The more things I was exposed to, and the more research I did, the more I decided to branch out. I still am interested in making games at some point, but in order to start somewhere, I want to tackle the challenges of Web Development, and getting used to the world of Front and Back End development.</p>
        <p class="par"> What I plan to do in the future is work somewhere in the area of Front-End development. Working with HTML/CSS, some JavaScript and other frameworks, but also working with the idea of designing websites also interests me. As I continue to learn more about CSS and perfect my "vision" with designing, this website will be periodically updated with new looks and functionalities.</p>
        <p class="par"> For now, though, I am in college, on the hunt for internships, and working on my own projects!</p>

        <!-- Interests -->
        <div class="sticky-header">
            <h2 class="header2"><u>Interests</u></h2>
        </div>
        <p class="par">Although I am a CS major, I have interests in the arts, more specifically music! I have three guitars, which I have acquired over the years (No I do not have money like that). They are: </p>
        <ul class="lista">
            <li>A Squier Stratocaster</li>
            <li>An Ibanez V70CE</li>
            <li>An Ibanez GRGR120EX</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="par">I don't have a big amp, just a Fender Frontman 10G.</p>

        <p>*Images coming soon*</p>
        <p class="par"><br>In terms of music genres, I like artists like Polyphia, The Black Keys, and FIDLAR. I like rock specifically, but I also like to branch out at times to jazz, chill and pop. Other artists I tend to branch off to are Laufey, Syncatto, and others in their genres.</p>
